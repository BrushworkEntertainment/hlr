                    "What if?" - That question stands at the heart of Half-Life 2: Reflections Story.
                    Through a completely original 4-hour campaign we plan to let players experience an alternate reality of the Half-Life universe.
                    Using an entirely new, more slow-paced and puzzle-focused gameplay style with its own quirks and mechanics, you get to experience Half-Life in a new, but eerily familiar, light.

                        The Standout feature of Half-Life 2: Reflection.
                        The main component of many puzzles and a playful - yet also skillful - addition to an already beautifully immersive world.
